> [!NOTE]
> In the previous table, we see that for RSA 2,048-bit software keys, 2,000 GET transactions per 10 seconds are allowed. For RSA 2,048-bit HSM-keys, 1,000 GET transactions per 10 seconds are allowed.
>
> The throttling thresholds are weighted, and enforcement is on their sum. For example, as shown in the previous table, when you perform GET operations on RSA HSM-keys, it's eight times more expensive to use 4,096-bit keys compared to 2,048-bit keys. That's because 1,000/125 = 8.

> In a given 10-second interval, an Azure Key Vault client can do *only one* of the following operations before it encounters a `429` throttling HTTP status code:
> - 2,000 RSA 2,048-bit software-key GET transactions
> - 1,000 RSA 2,048-bit HSM-key GET transactions
> - 125 RSA 4,096-bit HSM-key GET transactions
> - 124 RSA 4,096-bit HSM-key GET transactions and 8 RSA 2,048-bit HSM-key GET transactions

| 事务类型 | Maximum transactions allowed in 10 seconds, per vault per region<sup>1</sup> |
| --- | --- |
| 所有事务 |2,000 |

For information on how to handle throttling when these limits are exceeded, see [Azure Key Vault throttling guidance](../articles/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-throttling.md).

<sup>1</sup> A subscription-wide limit for all transaction types is five times per key vault limit. For example, HSM-other transactions per subscription are limited to 5,000 transactions in 10 seconds per subscription.
