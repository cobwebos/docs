Azure 计算提供独立于特定硬件类型并专用于单个客户的虚拟机大小。  这些虚拟机大小非常适合于与其他客户的工作负载（涉及符合性和法规要求等元素）高度隔离的工作负载。  客户还可以选择利用[对嵌套虚拟机的 Azure 支持](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/)，对这些独立的虚拟机资源进一步细分。

使用独立大小可保证你的虚拟机将是在特定服务器实例上唯一运行的虚拟机。  当前的独立虚拟机产品/服务包括：
* Standard_E64is_v3
* Standard_E64i_v3
* Standard_M128ms
* Standard_GS5
* Standard_G5
* Standard_DS15_v2
* Standard_D15_v2
* Standard_F72s_v2

You can learn more about each available isolated size [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-memory).

## <a name="retiring-d15_v2ds15_v2-isolation-on-february-15-2020"></a>Retiring D15_v2/DS15_v2 isolation on February 15, 2020
We recently announced the Preview of Azure Dedicated Host, which allows you to run your organization’s Linux and Windows virtual machines on single-tenant physical servers. We plan to fully replace isolated Azure VMs with Azure Dedicated Host. After **February 15, 2020** the D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure VMs may no longer be hardware isolated.

## <a name="how-does-this-affect-me"></a>How does this affect me?
After February 15, 2020, we will no longer provide an isolation guarantee for your D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure virtual machines. 

## <a name="what-actions-should-i-take"></a>What actions should I take?
If hardware isolation is not required for you, there is no action you need to take. 

If isolation is required to you, before February 15, 2020, you would need to either:

•   [Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-azure-dedicated-host) your workload to Azure Dedicated Host Preview

•   [Request access](https://aka.ms/D15iRequestAccess) to a D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2 Azure VM, to get the same price performance. This option is only available for pay-as-you-go and one-year reserved instance scenarios.    

•   [Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resize-virtual-machines/) your workload to another Azure isolated virtual machine. 

For details see below:

### <a name="q-why-am-i-not-seeing-the-new-dds15i_v2-sizes-in-the-portal"></a>Q: Why am I not seeing the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes in the portal?
**A**: If you are a current D/DS15_v2 customer and want to use the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes, please fill this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0FTPNXHdWpJlO27GE-bHitUMkZUWEFPNjFPNVgyMkhZS05FSzlPTzRIOS4u)

### <a name="q-why-i-am-not-seeing-any-quota-for-the-new-dds15i_v2-sizes"></a>Q: Why I am not seeing any quota for the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes?
**A**: If you are a current D/DS15_v2 customer and want to use the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes, please fill this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0FTPNXHdWpJlO27GE-bHitUNU1XUkhZWkNXQUFMNEJWUk9VWkRRVUJPMy4u)

### <a name="q-when-are-the-other-isolated-sizes-going-to-retire"></a>Q: When are the other isolated sizes going to retire?
**A**: We will provide reminders 12 months in advance of the official decommissioning of the sizes.

### <a name="q-is-there-a-downtime-when-my-vm-lands-on-a-non-isolated-hardware"></a>Q: Is there a downtime when my vm lands on a non-isolated hardware?
**A**: If you do not need isolation you do not need to take any action and you would not see any downtime.

### <a name="q-are-there-any-cost-changes-for-moving-to-a-non-isolated-virtual-machine"></a>Q: Are there any cost changes for moving to a non-isolated virtual machine?
**A**: No 

### <a name="q-i-already-purchased-1--or-3-year-reserved-instance-for-d15_v2-or-ds15_v2-how-will-the-discount-be-applied-to-my-vm-usage"></a>Q: I already purchased 1- or 3-year Reserved Instance for D15_v2 or Ds15_v2. How will the discount be applied to my VM usage?
**A**: RIs purchased before November 18, 2019 will automatically extend coverage to the new isolated VM series. 

| RI |  Instance Size Flexibility | Benefit eligibility |   
| --- | --- | --- |
|   D15_v2  |   关闭     |   D15_v2 and D15i_v2 |    
|   D15_v2  |   开  |   D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |    
|   D14_v2  |   开  |   D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |    
 
Likewise for Dsv2 series.
 
### <a name="q-i-want-to-purchase-additional-reserved-instances-for-dv2-which-one-should-i-choose"></a>Q: I want to purchase additional Reserved Instances for Dv2. Which one should I choose?
**A**: All RIs purchased after Nov 18, 2019, have the following behavior. 

| RI |  Instance Size Flexibility | Benefit eligibility |   
| --- | --- | --- |
| D15_v2 |  关闭 |   D15_v2 only  
| D15_v2 |  开 |    D15_v2 series will receive the RI benefit. The new D15i_v2 will not be eligible for RI benefit from this RI type. | 
| D15i_v2 |     关闭 | D15i_v2 only |  
| D15i_v2 |     开  | D15i_v2 only | 
 
Instance Size Flexibility cannot be used to apply to any other sizes such as D2_v2, D4_v2, or D15_v2. Likewise, for Dsv2 series.  
 
### <a name="q-can-i-buy-a-new-3-year-ri-for-d15i_v2-and-ds15i_v2"></a>Q: Can I buy a new 3-year RI for D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2?
**A**: Unfortunately no, only 1-year RI is available for new purchase.
 
### <a name="q-can-i-move-my-existing-d15_v2ds15_v2-reserve-instance-to-an-isolated-size-reserved-instance"></a>Q: Can I move my existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserve Instance to an isolated size Reserved Instance?
**A**: This is not necessary since the benefit will apply to both isolated and non-isolated sizes. But Azure will support changing existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserved Instances to D15i_v2/DS15i_v2. For all other Dv2/Dsv2 Reserved Instances, use the existing Reserved Instance or buy new Reserved Instances for the isolated sizes.
