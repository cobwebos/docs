Management of contributions from collaborators depends on the current status of the app.

**For [authoring resource migrated](../luis-migration-authoring.md) apps**: _contributors_ are managed in the Azure portal for the authoring resource, using the **Access control (IAM)** page. Add a user, using the collaborator's email address and the _contributor_ role. 

**For apps that have not migrated yet**: all _collaborators_ are managed in the LUIS portal from each app's **Manage -> Collaborators** page. On this page, [add a user's email address](../luis-how-to-collaborate.md). This provides authoring access to this app only.
