Bing Custom Search empowers businesses of any size, hobbyists, developers, and entrepreneurs to create tailored search experiences for intents and topics that they really care about. To create a custom search service, follow these three steps: 

1. Sign-up to the Custom Search Portal to build your custom search service
2. Publish your custom search service
3. Integrate your search service into an application endpoint

## <a name="use-cases"></a>Use cases
Bing Custom Search allows you to build, for example, site search or topical search services. You can programmatically retrieve your custom results via Bing Web Search API, using a `customconfig` parameter. Bing Web Search API returns a JSON file with the customized results. You can then integrate these results into many search endpoint applications. For example, you can show them on private websites, or public websites, in a blog, or in an app.

Upon sign-up, you are granted a free Azure subscription key.

- You decide which sites to search over. In this sense, Bing Custom Search is market and language agnostic.
- The built-in feature that suggests additional slices of the web for your search are English-sites only.
