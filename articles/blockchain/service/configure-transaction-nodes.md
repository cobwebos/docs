# <a name="configure-azure-blockchain-service-transaction-nodes"></a>Configure Azure Blockchain Service transaction nodes

Transaction nodes are used to send blockchain transactions to Azure Blockchain Service through a public endpoint. The default transaction node contains the private key of the Ethereum account registered on the blockchain, and as such cannot be deleted.

To view the default transaction node details:

1. 登录到 [Azure 门户](https://portal.azure.com)。
1. 导航到你的 Azure 区块链服务成员。 Select **Transaction nodes**.

    ![选择默认事务节点](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/nodes.png)

    Overview details include public endpoint addresses and public key.

## <a name="create-transaction-node"></a>创建事务节点

You can add up to nine additional transaction nodes to your blockchain member, for a total of 10 transaction nodes. By adding transaction nodes, you can increase scalability or distribute load. For example, you could have a transaction node endpoint for different client applications.

To add a transaction node:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Blockchain Service member and select **Transaction nodes > Add**.
1. Complete the settings for the new transaction node.

    ![Add transaction node](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/add-node.png)

    | 设置 | 描述 |
    |---------|-------------|
    | 名称 | 事务节点名称。 该名称用于创建事务节点终结点的 DNS 地址。 例如，`newnode-myblockchainmember.blockchain.azure.com` 。 The node name cannot be changed once it is created. |
    | 密码 | Set a strong password. Use the password to access the transaction node endpoint with basic authentication.

1. 选择**创建**。

    预配新的事务节点大约需要 10 分钟时间。 Additional transaction nodes incur cost. For more information on costs, see [Azure pricing](https://aka.ms/ABSPricing).

## <a name="endpoints"></a>终结点

Transaction nodes have a unique DNS name and public endpoints.

To view a transaction node's endpoint details:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Overview**.

    ![终结点](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/endpoints.png)

Transaction node endpoints are secure and require authentication. You can connect to a transaction endpoint using Azure AD authentication, HTTPS basic authentication, and using an access key over HTTPS or Websocket over SSL.

### <a name="azure-active-directory-access-control"></a>Azure Active Directory 访问控制

Azure Blockchain Service transaction node endpoints support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. You can grant Azure AD user, group, and service principal access to your endpoint.

To grant Azure AD access control to your endpoint:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Blockchain Service member and select **Transaction nodes > Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment**.
1. Create a new role assignment for a user, group, or service principal (application roles).

    ![Add IAM role](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/add-role.png)

    | 设置 | 行动 |
    |---------|-------------|
    | 角色 | Select **Owner**, **Contributor**, or **Reader**.
    | 将访问权限分配到 | Select **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**.
    | Select | Search for the user, group, or service principal you want to add.

1. Select **Save** to add the role assignment.

For more information on Azure AD access control, see [Manage access to Azure resources using RBAC and the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)

For details on how to connect using Azure AD authentication, see [connect to your node using AAD authentication](configure-aad.md).

### <a name="basic-authentication"></a>基本身份验证

For HTTPS basic authentication, user name and password credentials are passed in the HTTPS header of the request to the endpoint.

You can view a transaction node's basic authentication endpoint details in the Azure portal. Navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Basic Authentication** in settings.

![基本身份验证](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/basic.png)

The user name is the name of your node and cannot be changed.

To use the URL, replace \<password\> with the password set when the node was provisioned. You can update the password by selecting **Reset password**.

### <a name="access-keys"></a>访问密钥

For access key authentication, the access key is included in the endpoint URL. When the transaction node is provisioned, two access keys are generated. Either access key can be used for authentication. Two keys enable you to change and rotate keys.

You can view a transaction node's access key details and copy endpoint addresses that include the access keys. Navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Access Keys** in settings.

### <a name="firewall-rules"></a>防火墙规则

Firewall rules enable you to limit the IP addresses that can attempt to authenticate to your transaction node.  If no firewall rules are configured for your transaction node, it cannot be accessed by any party.  

To view a transaction node's firewall rules, navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Firewall rules** in settings.

You can add firewall rules by entering a rule name, starting IP address, and an ending IP address in the **Firewall rules** grid.

![防火墙规则](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/firewall-rules.png)

To enable:

* **Single IP address:** Configure the same IP address for the starting and ending IP addresses.
* **IP address range:** Configure the starting and ending IP address range. For example, a range starting at 10.221.34.0 and ending at 10.221.34.255 would enable the entire 10.221.34.xxx subnet.
* **Allow all IP addresses:** Configure the starting IP address to 0.0.0.0 and the ending IP address to 255.255.255.255.

## <a name="connection-strings"></a>连接字符串

Connection string syntax for your transaction node is provided for basic authentication or using access keys. Connection strings including access keys over HTTPS and WebSockets are provided.

You can view a transaction node's connection strings and copy endpoint addresses. Navigate to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Connection strings** in settings.

![连接字符串](./media/configure-transaction-nodes/connection-strings.png)

## <a name="sample-code"></a>代码示例

Sample code is provided to quickly enable connecting to your transaction node via Web3, Nethereum, Web3js, and Truffle.

You can view a transaction node's sample connection code and copy it to use with popular developer tools. Go to one of your Azure Blockchain Service member transaction nodes and select **Sample Code** in settings.

Choose the Web3, Nethereum, Truffle, or Web3j tab to view the code sample you want to use.
