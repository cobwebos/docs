# <a name="management-concepts-for-user-accounts-passwords-and-administration-in-azure-active-directory-domain-services"></a>Management concepts for user accounts, passwords, and administration in Azure Active Directory Domain Services

When you create and run an Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) managed domain, there are some differences in behavior compared to a traditional on-premises AD DS environment. You use the same administrative tools in Azure AD DS as a self-managed domain, but you can't directly access the domain controllers (DC). There's also some differences in behavior for password policies and password hashes depending on the source of the user account creation.

This conceptual article details how to administer an Azure AD DS managed domain and the different behavior of user accounts depending on the way they're created.

## <a name="domain-management"></a>Domain management

In Azure AD DS, the domain controllers (DCs) that contain all the resources like users and groups, credentials, and policies are part of the managed service. For redundancy, two DCs are created as part of an Azure AD DS managed domain. You can't sign in to these DCs to perform management tasks. Instead, you create a management VM that's joined to the Azure AD DS managed domain, then install your regular AD DS management tools. You can use the Active Directory Administrative Center or Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins like DNS or Group Policy objects, for example.

## <a name="user-account-creation"></a>User account creation

User accounts can be created in Azure AD DS in multiple ways. Most user accounts are synchronized in from Azure AD, which can also include user account synchronized from an on-premises AD DS environment. You can also manually create accounts directly in Azure AD DS. Some features, like initial password synchronization or password policy, behave differently depending on how and where user accounts are created.

* The user account can be synchronized in from Azure AD. This includes cloud-only user accounts created directly in Azure AD, and hybrid user accounts synchronized from an on-premises AD DS environment using Azure AD Connect.
    * The majority of user accounts in Azure AD DS are created through the synchronization process from Azure AD.
* The user account can be manually created in an Azure AD DS managed domain, and doesn't exist in Azure AD.
    * If you need to create service accounts for applications that only run in Azure AD DS, you can manually create them in the managed domain. As synchronization is one-way from Azure AD, user accounts created in Azure AD DS aren't synchronized back to Azure AD.

## <a name="password-policy"></a>密码策略

Azure AD DS includes a default password policy that defines settings for things like account lockout, maximum password age, and password complexity. Settings like account lockout policy apply to all users in Azure AD DS, regardless of how the user was created as outlined in the previous section. A few settings, like minimum password length and password complexity, only apply to users created directly in Azure AD DS.

You can create your own custom password policies to override the default policy in Azure AD DS. These custom policies can then be applied to specific groups of users as needed.

For more information on the differences in how password policies are applied depending on the source of user creation, see [Password and account lockout policies on managed domains][password-policy].

## <a name="password-hashes"></a>Password hashes

若要对托管域上的用户进行身份验证，Azure AD DS 需要密码哈希，其格式适用于 NT LAN Manager (NTLM) 和 Kerberos 身份验证。 除非为租户启用了 Azure AD DS，否则 Azure AD 不会以 NTLM 或 Kerberos 身份验证所需的格式生成或存储密码哈希。 出于安全考虑，Azure AD 也不以明文形式存储任何密码凭据。 因此，Azure AD 无法基于用户的现有凭据自动生成这些 NTLM 或 Kerberos 密码哈希。

对于仅限云的用户帐户，用户必须更改其密码才能使用 Azure AD DS。 此密码更改过程会导致在 Azure AD 中生成并存储用于 Kerberos 和 NTLM 身份验证的密码哈希。

For users synchronized from an on-premises AD DS environment using Azure AD Connect, [enable synchronization of password hashes][hybrid-phs].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD Connect only synchronizes legacy password hashes when you enable Azure AD DS for your Azure AD tenant. Legacy password hashes aren't used if you only use Azure AD Connect to synchronize an on-premises AD DS environment with Azure AD.
>
> If your legacy applications don't use NTLM authentication or LDAP simple binds, we recommend that you disable NTLM password hash synchronization for Azure AD DS. For more information, see [Disable weak cipher suites and NTLM credential hash synchronization][secure-domain].

经过适当的配置后，可用的密码哈希将存储在 Azure AD DS 托管域中。 删除 Azure AD DS 托管域也会删除其中存储的所有密码哈希。 Synchronized credential information in Azure AD can't be reused if you later create an Azure AD DS managed domain - you must reconfigure the password hash synchronization to store the password hashes again. 以前加入域的 VM 或用户无法立即进行身份验证 - Azure AD 需要在新的 Azure AD DS 托管域中生成并存储密码哈希。 有关详细信息，请参阅 [Azure AD DS 和 Azure AD Connect 的密码哈希同步过程][azure-ad-password-sync]。

## <a name="forests-and-trusts"></a>Forests and trusts

A *forest* is a logical construct used by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to group one or more *domains*. The domains then store objects for user or groups, and provide authentication services.

In Azure AD DS, the forest only contains one domain. On-premises AD DS forests often contain many domains. In large organizations, especially after mergers and acquisitions, you may end up with multiple on-premises forests that each then contain multiple domains.

By default, an Azure AD DS managed domain is created as a *user* forest. This type of forest synchronizes all objects from Azure AD, including any user accounts created in an on-premises AD DS environment. User accounts can directly authenticate against the Azure AD DS managed domain, such as to sign in to a domain-joined VM. A user forest works when the password hashes can be synchronized and users aren't using exclusive sign-in methods like smart card authentication.

In an Azure AD DS *resource* forest, users authenticate over a one-way forest *trust* from their on-premises AD DS. With this approach, the user objects and password hashes aren't synchronized to Azure AD DS. The user objects and credentials only exist in the on-premises AD DS. This approach lets enterprises host resources and application platforms in Azure that depend on classic authentication such LDAPS, Kerberos, or NTLM, but any authentication issues or concerns are removed. Azure AD DS resource forests are currently in preview.

For more information about forest types in Azure AD DS, see [What are resource forests?][concepts-forest] and [How do forest trusts work in Azure AD DS?][concepts-trust]
