*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Azure Stack provides a variety of networking capabilities that can be used together or separately:
- Connectivity between Azure Stack resources: connect Azure resources together in a secure, private virtual network in the cloud.
- Internet connectivity: communicate to and from Azure Stack resources over the Internet.
- On-premises connectivity: connect an on-premises network to Azure Stack resources through a virtual private network (VPN) over the Internet, or through a dedicated connection to Azure Stack.
- Load balancing and traffic direction: load balance traffic to servers in the same location and direct traffic to servers in different locations.
- Security: filter network traffic between network subnets or individual virtual machines (VM).
- Routing: use default routing or fully control routing between your Azure Stack and on-premises resources.
- Manageability: monitor and manage your Azure Stack networking resources.
- Deployment and configuration tools: use a web-based portal or cross-platform command-line tools to deploy and configure network resources.
