# Azure Stack Storage: Differences and considerations
<a id="azure-stack-storage-differences-and-considerations" class="xliff"></a>
Azure Stack Storage is the set of storage cloud services in Microsoft Azure Stack. Azure Stack Storage provides blob, table, queue, and account management functionality with Azure-consistent semantics.

This article summarizes the known Azure Stack Storage differences from Azure Storage. It also summarizes other considerations to keep in mind when you deploy Azure Stack. To learn about high-level differences between Azure Stack and Azure, see the [Key considerations](azure-stack-considerations.md) topic.

### Metrics
<a id="metrics" class="xliff"></a>
There are also some differences with storage metrics:
* The transaction data in storage metrics does not differentiate internal or external network bandwidth.
* The transaction data in storage metrics does not include virtual machine access to the mounted disks.

## API version
<a id="api-version" class="xliff"></a>
The following versions are supported with Azure Stack Storage:

* Azure Storage data services: [2015-04-05 REST API version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/Version-2015-04-05?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
* Azure Storage management services: [2015-05-01-preview, 2015-06-15, and 2016-01-01](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storagerp/?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
