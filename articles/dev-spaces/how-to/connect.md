# <a name="connect-your-development-machine-to-an-aks-cluster-preview"></a>将开发计算机连接到 AKS 群集（预览版）

Azure Dev Spaces allows you to run and debug code with or without a container on your development machine, while still connected to your Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your application or services. Connecting your development machine to your cluster helps you to quickly develop your application and perform end-to-end testing without having to create any Docker or Kubernetes configuration. You can also connect to your AKS cluster without affecting other workloads or users who may be using the same cluster.

Azure Dev Spaces redirects traffic between your connected AKS cluster and your development machine. This traffic redirection allows code on your development machine and services running in your AKS cluster to communicate as if they are in the same AKS cluster. Since your code is running on your development machine, you also have flexibility in the development tools you are using to run and debug that code. Azure Dev Spaces also provides a way to replicate environment variables and mounted files available to pods in your AKS cluster in your development machine.

本指南介绍如何执行以下操作：

* 在 Azure 中的托管 Kubernetes 群集上设置 Azure Dev Spaces。
* 将包含多个微服务的大型应用程序部署到开发空间。
* Use Azure Dev Spaces to redirect traffic between your AKS cluster and code running on your development machine.

> 此功能目前处于预览状态。 需同意[补充使用条款](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)才可使用预览版。 在正式版 (GA) 推出之前，此功能的某些方面可能会有所更改。

## <a name="before-you-begin"></a>开始之前

This guide uses the [Azure Dev Spaces Bike Sharing sample application](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/tree/master/samples/BikeSharingApp) to demonstrate connecting your development machine to an AKS cluster. Follow the instructions in the [Azure Dev Spaces Bike Sharing sample application README](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/blob/master/samples/BikeSharingApp/README.md) to run the sample application. Alternatively, if you have your own application on an AKS cluster you can still follow the steps below and use the names of your own services and pods.

### <a name="limitations"></a>限制

* UDP is not supported at this time.

### <a name="prerequisites"></a>必备组件

* Azure 订阅。 如果没有 Azure 订阅，可以创建一个[免费帐户](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)。
* [已安装 Azure CLI][azure-cli]。
* [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] with the [Azure Dev Spaces][azds-vs-code] extension installed and running on MacOS or Windows 10.
* The [Azure Dev Spaces Bike Sharing sample application](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/tree/master/samples/BikeSharingApp) or your own application running on an AKS cluster.

## <a name="connect-your-development-machine"></a>Connect your development machine

Open *dev-spaces/samples/BikeSharingApp/Bikes* in Visual Studio Code and use the Azure Dev Spaces extension to connect your development machine to your AKS cluster.

To use the Azure Dev Spaces extension, open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code by clicking *View* then *Command Palette*. Begin typing `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect` and click on either `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes service to my machine [Preview]`, `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes pod to my machine [Preview]`, or `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect a new Kubernetes pod to my machine [Preview]`.

![命令](../media/how-to-connect/connect-commands.png)

### <a name="select-a-redirection-option"></a>Select a redirection option

If you run `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes service to my machine [Preview]`, you are asked to choose an existing Kubernetes service:

![Choose Service](../media/how-to-connect/connect-choose-service.png)

This option redirects all traffic in the AKS cluster for this service to the version of your application running in your development machine. If this service has multiple pods running in the AKS cluster, all traffic for this service is only routed to your development machine. Azure Dev Spaces also routes all outbound traffic from the application back to your AKS cluster.

If you run `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes pod to my machine [Preview]`, you are asked to choose a specific pod:

![Choose Pod](../media/how-to-connect/connect-choose-pod.png)

This option connects to a specific pod. This option is useful for interacting with pods that do not send or receive traffic and replicating terminated pods. If the pod does send and receive traffic, this option behaves in a similar way to `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes service to my machine [Preview]` and will redirect all traffic in the AKS cluster for all pods related to the service of the selected pod.

If you run `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect a new Kubernetes pod to my machine [Preview]`, you are not prompted to select an existing pod or service. This option redirects all outbound traffic from the application running on your development machine to the AKS cluster.

For this example, choose `Azure Dev Spaces: Redirect an existing Kubernetes service to my machine [Preview]` and select the *bikes* service.

### <a name="select-a-connection-mode"></a>Select a connection mode

After you select your redirection option, you are prompted to choose either the *Replace* or *Clone* connection mode.

![Replace or Clone](../media/how-to-connect/connect-replace-clone.png)

The *Replace* option replaces current pod or service in the AKS cluster and redirects all the traffic for that service to your development machine. This option can be disruptive to other services in your AKS cluster that interact with the service you are redirecting may not function until you start the application on your development machine. The *Clone* option allows you to choose an existing child dev space or create a new child dev space for redirecting traffic for a pod or service to your development machine. This option allows you to work in isolation and not disrupt other services since only traffic to that child dev space will be redirected to your development machine. The *Clone* option requires your AKS cluster to have Azure Dev Spaces enabled.

For this example, choose *Replace*.

> [!NOTE]
> If your existing service's pod has multiple containers, you are also prompted to choose the application's container.

### <a name="select-a-port-for-your-application"></a>Select a port for your application

After you select your connection mode, you are prompted to enter the TCP port your local application. If your application opens multiple ports, separate them by a comma for example *80,81*. If your application does not accept any network requests, enter *0*. For this example, enter *3000*.

![Connect choose port](../media/how-to-connect/connect-choose-port.png)

### <a name="confirm-you-are-connected"></a>Confirm you are connected

After you select your application's TCP port, Azure Dev Spaces will establish a connection to the AKS cluster. Azure Dev Spaces injects an agent into your AKS cluster to redirect traffic between the AKS cluster and your development machine. Establishing this connection may take a few minutes. Azure Dev Spaces will also request administrator access in order to modify the *hosts* file in your development machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once Azure Dev Spaces establishes a connection to your AKS cluster, the other services in your AKS cluster may not function correctly until you start the service in your development machine if you choose the *Replace* connection mode. You can choose the *Clone* connection mode instead to create a child dev space for your redirection and avoid any disruption to the parent space. Also, if your service has a dependency that is not available in your development machine, you may need to modify your application or provide [additional configuration](#additional-configuration)

Azure Dev Spaces opens a terminal window titled *AZDS Connect - Bikes* after it establishes a connection to your AKS cluster. This terminal window has all the environment variables and DNS entries configured from your AKS cluster. Any code you run in this terminal window or using the Visual Studio Code debugger is connected to the AKS cluster.

![Terminal](../media/how-to-connect/connect-terminal.png)

Additionally, Azure Dev Spaces creates a window titled *Dev Spaces Connect* with all its output.

![输出](../media/how-to-connect/connect-output.png)

Azure Dev Spaces also has a status bar item showing the connection status.

![状态](../media/how-to-connect/connect-status.png)

Verify the status bar shows *Dev Spaces: Connected to dev/bikes on local port 3000*.

### <a name="configure-your-application-on-your-development-machine"></a>Configure your application on your development machine

Open the *AZDS Connect - Bikes* terminal window and run `npm install`:

```console
$ npm install

> fsevents@1.2.9 install ./dev-spaces/samples/BikeSharingApp/Bikes/node_modules/fsevents
> node install
...
```

Click *Debug* then *Open Configurations*. If prompted to select an environment, choose *Node.js*.This creates a `.vscode/launch.json` file. Replace the contents of that file with the following:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch via NPM",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "run-script",
                "debug"
            ],
            "port": 9229
        }
    ]
}
```

Open [package.json](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/blob/master/samples/BikeSharingApp/Bikes/package.json) and add a debugging script:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^1.18.10"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "debug": "node --nolazy --inspect-brk=9229 server.js"
  }
```

### <a name="start-your-application-on-your-development-machine"></a>Start your application on your development machine

Click on the *Debug* icon on the left and click on the start button next to *Launch via NPM* at the top.

![Launch via NPM](../media/how-to-connect/launch-npm.png)

Your application will start and Azure Dev Spaces redirects traffic between your AKS cluster and your development machine. You will see messages similar to the below in the *Debug Console*:

```console
/usr/local/bin/npm run-script debug 
...
Debugger attached.
Collection: bikes
MongoDB connection string: mongodb://databases-mongo
Connected to MongoDB
Listening on port 3000
```

Navigate to the *bikesharingweb* service by clicking on the Azure Dev Spaces status bar and choosing the public URL of your application. You can also find the public URL from the `azds list-uris` command you ran earlier. If you are not using Azure Dev Spaces on your cluster, use the IP or the URL for the application for the namespace you are using. 在以上示例中，*bikesharingweb* 服务的公共 URL 为 `http://dev.bikesharingweb.fedcab0987.eus.azds.io/`。 Select *Aurelia Briggs (customer)* as the user, then select a bike to rent.

### <a name="set-a-break-point"></a>Set a break point

Open [server.js](https://github.com/Azure/dev-spaces/blob/master/samples/BikeSharingApp/Bikes/server.js#L233) and click somewhere on line 233 to put your cursor there. Set a breakpoint by hitting *F9* or clicking *Debug* then *Toggle Breakpoint*.

Navigate to the *bikesharingweb* service by opening the public URL. Select *Aurelia Briggs (customer)* as the user, then select a bike to rent. Notice the image for the bike does not load. Return to Visual Studio Code and observe line 233 is highlighted. The breakpoint you set has paused the service at line 233. 若要恢复服务，请按 *F5*，或者依次单击“调试”、“继续”。 Return to your browser and verify you see a placeholder image for the bike.

Remove the breakpoint by putting your cursor on line 233 in `server.js` and hitting *F9*.

### <a name="update-your-application"></a>更新应用程序

Edit `server.js` to remove lines 232 and 233:

```javascript
    // Hard code image url *FIX ME*
    theBike.imageUrl = "/static/logo.svg";
```

The section should now look like:

```javascript
    var theBike = result;
    theBike.id = theBike._id;
    delete theBike._id;
```

Save your changes and click *Debug* then *Restart Debugging*. Refresh your browser and verify that you no longer see a placeholder image for the bike.

依次单击“调试”、“停止调试”以停止调试器。 Click on the Azure Dev Spaces status bar to disconnect from the AKS cluster.

## <a name="additional-configuration"></a>其他配置

Azure Dev Spaces can handle routing traffic and replicating environment variables without any additional configuration. If you need to download any files that are mounted to the container in your AKS cluster, such as a ConfigMap file, you can create a `azds-local.env` to download those files to your development machine.

Here is an example `azds-local.env`:

```
# This downloads the "whitelist" volume from the container,
# saves it to a temporary directory on your development machine,
# and sets the full path to an environment variable called WHITELIST_PATH.

WHITELIST_PATH=${volumes.whitelist}/whitelist

# This downloads a file from the container's 'default-token-<any>' mount directory 
# to /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount on your development machine.

KUBERNETES_IN_CLUSTER_CONFIG_OVERWRITE=${volumes.default-token-*|/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount}


# This makes the myapp1 service available to your development machine
# regardless of the AKS cluster you are connected to and
# sets the local IP to an environment variable called MYAPP1_SERVICE_HOST.

MYAPP1_SERVICE_HOST=${services.myapp1}

# If the myapp1 service is made available in this way, 
# you can also access it using "myapp1" and "myapp1.svc.cluster.local"
# in addition to the IP in the MYAPP1_SERVICE_HOST environment variable.
```

## <a name="using-logging-and-diagnostics"></a>Using logging and diagnostics

Logging output is written to the *Dev Spaces Connect* window after connect your development machine to your AKS cluster.

![输出](../media/how-to-connect/connect-output.png)

Click on the Azure Dev Spaces status bar and choose *Show diagnostics info*. This command prints the current environment variables and DNS entires in the logging output.

![Output with diagnostics](../media/how-to-connect/connect-output-diagnostics.png)

Additionally, you can find the diagnostic logs in `Azure Dev Spaces` directory in your [development machine's *TEMP* directory][azds-tmp-dir].
