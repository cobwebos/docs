# <a name="remote-desktop-client-connections"></a>远程桌面客户端连接

Use this article to resolve issues with Windows Virtual Desktop client connections.

## <a name="provide-feedback"></a>提供反馈

请访问 [Windows 虚拟桌面技术社区](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop)，与产品团队和活跃的社区成员共同探讨 Windows 虚拟桌面服务。

## <a name="you-cant-open-a-web-client"></a>You can't open a web client

Confirm there's internet connectivity by opening another web site; for example, [www.Bing.com](https://www.bing.com).

Use **nslookup** to confirm DNS can resolve the FQDN:

```cmd
nslookup rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com
```

Try connecting with another client, like Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 or Windows 10, and check to see if you can open the web client.

### <a name="error-opening-another-site-fails"></a>Error: Opening another site fails

**Cause:** Network issues and/or outages.

**Fix:** Contact network support.

### <a name="error-nslookup-cannot-resolve-the-name"></a>Error: Nslookup cannot resolve the name

**Cause:** Network issues and/or outages.

**Fix:** Contact network support

### <a name="error-you-cant-connect-but-other-clients-can-connect"></a>Error: You can't connect but other clients can connect

**Cause:** The browser isn't behaving as expected and stopped working.

**Fix:** Follow these instructions to troubleshoot the browser.

1. Restart the browser.
2. Clear browser cookies. See [How to delete cookie files in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/278835/how-to-delete-cookie-files-in-internet-explorer).
3. 清除浏览器缓存。 See [clear browser cache for your browser](https://binged.it/2RKyfdU).
4. Open browser in Private mode.

## <a name="web-client-stops-responding-or-disconnects"></a>Web client stops responding or disconnects

Try connecting using another browser or client.

### <a name="error-other-browsers-and-clients-also-malfunction-or-fail-to-open"></a>Error: Other browsers and clients also malfunction or fail to open

**Cause:** Network and/or operation system issues or outages

**Fix:** Contact support teams.

## <a name="web-client-keeps-prompting-for-credentials"></a>Web client keeps prompting for credentials

If the Web client keeps prompting for credentials, follow these instructions.

1. Confirm web client URL is correct.
2. Confirm that credentials are for the Windows Virtual Desktop environment tied to the URL.
3. Clear browser cookies. See [How to delete cookie files in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/278835/how-to-delete-cookie-files-in-internet-explorer).
4. 清除浏览器缓存。 See [Clear browser cache for your browser](https://binged.it/2RKyfdU).
5. Open browser in Private mode.

## <a name="remote-desktop-client-for-windows-7-or-windows-10-stops-responding-or-cannot-be-opened"></a>Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 or Windows 10 stops responding or cannot be opened

Use the following PowerShell cmdlets to clean up out-of-band (OOB) client registries.

```PowerShell
Remove-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default' - Name FeedURLs

#Remove RdClientRadc registry key
Remove-Item 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\RdClientRadc' -Recurse

#Remove all files under %appdata%\RdClientRadc
Remove-Item C:\Users\pavithir\AppData\Roaming\RdClientRadc\* -Recurse
```

Navigate to **%AppData%\RdClientRadc** and delete all content.

Uninstall and reinstall Remote Desktop client for Windows 7 and Windows 10.

## <a name="troubleshooting-end-user-connectivity"></a>Troubleshooting end-user connectivity

Sometimes users can access their feed and local resources, but still have configuration, availability, or performance issues that prevent them from accessing remote resources. In these cases, the user gets messages similar to these:

![Remote Desktop Connection error message.](media/eb76b666808bddb611448dfb621152ce.png)

![Can't connect to the gateway error message.](media/a8fbb9910d4672147335550affe58481.png)

Follow these general troubleshooting instructions for client connection error codes.

1. Confirm user name and time when issue was experienced.
2. Open **PowerShell** and establish connection to the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant where the issue was reported.
3. Confirm connection to the correct tenant with **Get-RdsTenant.**
4. Using **Get-RdsHostPool** and **Get-RdsSessionHost** cmdlets, confirm that troubleshooting is being done on the correct host pool.
5. Execute the command below to get a list of all failed activities of type connection for the specified time window:

    ```PowerShell
     Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -TenantName <TenantName> -username <UPN> -StartTime
     "11/21/2018 1:07:03 PM" -EndTime "11/21/2018 1:27:03 PM" -Outcome Failure -ActivityType Connection
    ```

6. Using the **ActivityId** from the previous cmdlet output, run the command below:

    ```PowerShell
    (Get-RdsDiagnosticActivities -TenantName <TenantName> -ActivityId <ActivityId> -Detailed).Errors
    ```

7. The command produces output similar to the output shown below. Use **ErrorCodeSymbolic** and **ErrorMessage** to troubleshoot the root cause.

    ```PowerShell
    ErrorSource       : <Source>
    ErrorOperation    : <Operation>
    ErrorCode         : <Error code>
    ErrorCodeSymbolic : <Error code string>
    ErrorMessage      : <Error code message>
    ErrorInternal     : <Internal for the OS>
    ReportedBy        : <Reported by component>
    Time              : <Timestampt>
    ```

### <a name="error-o_add_user_to_group_failed--failed-to-add-user--username-to-group--remote-desktop-users-reason-win32error_no_such_member"></a>Error: O_ADD_USER_TO_GROUP_FAILED / Failed to add user = ≤username≥ to group = Remote Desktop Users. Reason: Win32.ERROR_NO_SUCH_MEMBER

**Cause:** VM has not been joined to the domain where user object is.

**Fix:** Add VM to the correct domain. See [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-admin-guide-join-windows-vm-portal).

### <a name="error-nslookup-cannot-resolve-the-name"></a>Error: Nslookup cannot resolve the name

**Cause:** Network issues or outages.

**Fix:** Contact network support

### <a name="error-connectionfailedclientprotocolerror"></a>Error: ConnectionFailedClientProtocolError

**Cause:** VMs that user is attempting to connect to are not domain joined.

**Fix:** Join all VMs that are part of a host pool to the domain controller.

### <a name="error-connectionfailedusersidinformationmismatch"></a>Error: ConnectionFailedUserSIDInformationMismatch
**Cause:** The SID from the user's Azure Active Directory (AD) token doesn't match the SID returned by the domain controller when attempting to enable the user for remote sign in. This error typically happens when attempting to sign in to an Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) environment with a user originally sourced from a Windows Server AD.

**Fix:** This scenario isn't supported at this time. Only users sourced from Azure Active Directory can sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop VMs connected to Azure AD DS.

## <a name="user-connects-but-nothing-is-displayed-no-feed"></a>User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate, however the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

```PowerShell
Get-RdsAppGroupUser <tenantname> <hostpoolname> <appgroupname>
```

Confirm that the user is logging in with the correct credentials.

If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.
