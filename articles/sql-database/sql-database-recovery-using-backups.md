# <a name="recover-an-azure-sql-database-by-using-automated-database-backups"></a>Recover an Azure SQL database by using automated database backups

By default, Azure SQL Database backups are stored in geo-replicated blob storage (RA-GRS storage type). The following options are available for database recovery by using [automated database backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md). 你可以：

- Create a new database on the same SQL Database server, recovered to a specified point in time within the retention period.
- Create a database on the same SQL Database server, recovered to the deletion time for a deleted database.
- Create a new database on any SQL Database server in the same region, recovered to the point of the most recent backups.
- Create a new database on any SQL Database server in any other region, recovered to the point of the most recent replicated backups.

If you configured [backup long-term retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md), you can also create a new database from any long-term retention backup on any SQL Database server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't overwrite an existing database during restore.

When you're using the Standard or Premium service tiers, your database restore might incur an extra storage cost. The extra cost is incurred when the maximum size of the restored database is greater than the amount of storage included with the target database's service tier and performance level. 有关额外存储定价的详细信息，请参阅 [SQL 数据库定价页面](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/)。 If the actual amount of used space is less than the amount of storage included, you can avoid this extra cost by setting the maximum database size to the included amount.

## <a name="recovery-time"></a>恢复时间

The recovery time to restore a database by using automated database backups is affected by several factors:

- The size of the database.
- The compute size of the database.
- The number of transaction logs involved.
- The amount of activity that needs to be replayed to recover to the restore point.
- The network bandwidth if the restore is to a different region.
- 目标区域中正在处理的并行还原请求数。

For a large or very active database, the restore might take several hours. If there is a prolonged outage in a region, it's possible that a high number of geo-restore requests will be initiated for disaster recovery. When there are many requests, the recovery time for individual databases can increase. 大部分数据库还原操作可在 12 小时内完成。

For a single subscription, there are limitations on the number of concurrent restore requests. These limitations apply to any combination of point-in-time restores, geo-restores, and restores from long-term retention backup.

| | **处理的并发请求数最多为 #** | **提交的并发请求数最多为 #** |
| :--- | --: | --: |
|单个数据库（每个订阅）|10|60|
|弹性池（每个池）|4|200|

There isn't a built-in method to restore the entire server. For an example of how to accomplish this task, see [Azure SQL Database: Full Server Recovery](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-SQL-Database-Full-82941666).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To recover by using automated backups, you must be a member of the SQL Server contributor role in the subscription, or be the subscription owner. For more information, see [RBAC: Built-in roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md). You can recover by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the REST API. You can't use Transact-SQL.

## <a name="point-in-time-restore"></a>时间点还原

You can restore a standalone, pooled, or instance database to an earlier point in time by using the Azure portal, [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/restore-azsqldatabase), or the [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/sql/databases). The request can specify any service tier or compute size for the restored database. Ensure that you have sufficient resources on the server to which you are restoring the database. When complete, the restore creates a new database on the same server as the original database. The restored database is charged at normal rates, based on its service tier and compute size. You don't incur charges until the database restore is complete.

为了恢复目的，通常会将数据库还原到一个较早的点。 You can treat the restored database as a replacement for the original database, or use it as a data source to update the original database.

- **数据库替换**

  If you intend the restored database to be a replacement for the original database, you should specify the original database's compute size and service tier. You can then rename the original database, and give the restored database the original name by using the [ALTER DATABASE](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-azure-sql-database) command in T-SQL.

- **数据恢复**

  If you plan to retrieve data from the restored database to recover from a user or application error, you need to write and execute a  data recovery script that extracts data from the restored database and applies to the original database. 尽管还原操作可能需要很长时间才能完成，但整个还原过程中，都可在数据库列表中看到还原数据库。 If you delete the database during the restore, the restore operation will be canceled and you will not be charged for the database that did not complete the restore.

## <a name="deleted-database-restore"></a>已删除的数据库还原

You can restore a deleted database to the deletion time, or an earlier point in time, on the same SQL Database server or the same managed instance. You can accomplish this through the Azure portal, [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/restore-azsqldatabase), or the [REST (createMode=Restore)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/sql/databases/createorupdate). You restore a deleted database by creating a new database from the backup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete an Azure SQL Database server or managed instance, all its databases are also deleted, and can't be recovered. You can't restore a deleted server or managed instance.

### <a name="deleted-database-restore-by-using-the-azure-portal"></a>Deleted database restore by using the Azure portal

You restore deleted databases from the Azure portal from the server and instance resource.

## <a name="geo-restore"></a>异地还原

可在任何 Azure 区域的任何服务器上从最新异地复制的备份中还原 SQL 数据库。 Geo-restore uses a geo-replicated backup as its source. You can request geo-restore even if the database or datacenter is inaccessible due to an outage.

Geo-restore is the default recovery option when your database is unavailable because of an incident in the hosting region. You can restore the database to a server in any other region. 创建备份后，将其异地复制到其他区域中的 Azure Blob 时会出现延迟。 As a result, the restored database can be up to one hour behind the original database. The following illustration shows a database restore from the last available backup in another region.

![Graphic of geo-restore](./media/sql-database-geo-restore/geo-restore-2.png)

### <a name="geo-restore-by-using-the-azure-portal"></a>Geo-restore by using the Azure portal

From the Azure portal, you create a new single or managed instance database, and select an available geo-restore backup. The newly created database contains the geo-restored backup data.

#### <a name="single-azure-sql-database"></a>Single Azure SQL database

To geo-restore a single SQL database from the Azure portal in the region and server of your choice, follow these steps:

1. From **Dashboard**, select **Add** > **Create SQL Database**. On the **Basics** tab, enter the required information.
2. Select **Additional settings**.
3. For **Use existing data**, select **Backup**.
4. For **Backup**, select a backup from the list of available geo-restore backups.

    ![Screenshot of Create SQL Database options](./media/sql-database-recovery-using-backups/geo-restore-azure-sql-database-list-annotated.png)

Complete the process of creating a new database from the backup. When you create the single Azure SQL database, it contains the restored geo-restore backup.

#### <a name="managed-instance-database"></a>Managed instance database

To geo-restore a managed instance database from the Azure portal to an existing managed instance in a region of your choice, select a managed instance on which you want a database to be restored. 执行以下步骤：

1. Select **New database**.
2. Type a desired database name.
3. Under **Use existing data**, select **Backup**.
4. Select a backup from the list of available geo-restore backups.

    ![Screenshot of New database options](./media/sql-database-recovery-using-backups/geo-restore-sql-managed-instance-list-annotated.png)

Complete the process of creating a new database. When you create the instance database, it contains the restored geo-restore backup.

For a PowerShell script that shows how to perform geo-restore for a single SQL database, see [Use PowerShell to restore an Azure SQL single database to an earlier point in time](scripts/sql-database-restore-database-powershell.md).

#### <a name="managed-instance-database"></a>Managed instance database

For a PowerShell script that shows how to perform geo-restore for a managed instance database, see [Use PowerShell to restore a managed instance database to another geo-region](scripts/sql-managed-instance-restore-geo-backup.md).

### <a name="geo-restore-considerations"></a>Geo-restore considerations

You can't perform a point-in-time restore on a geo-secondary database. You can only do so on a primary database. 有关使用异地还原在中断后恢复的详细信息，请参阅[在中断后恢复](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md)。

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Geo-restore is the most basic disaster recovery solution available in SQL Database. It relies on automatically created geo-replicated backups with recovery point objective (RPO) equal to 1 hour, and the estimated recovery time of up to 12 hours. It doesn't guarantee that the target region will have the capacity to restore your databases after a regional outage, because a sharp increase of demand is likely. If your application uses relatively small databases and is not critical to the business, geo-restore is an appropriate disaster recovery solution. For business-critical applications that require large databases and must ensure business continuity, use [Auto-failover groups](sql-database-auto-failover-group.md). It offers a much lower RPO and recovery time objective, and the capacity is always guaranteed. 有关业务连续性选项的详细信息，请参阅[业务连续性概述](sql-database-business-continuity.md)。
