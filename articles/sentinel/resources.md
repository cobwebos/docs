### <a name="view-audit-and-reporting-data-in-azure-sentinel"></a>View audit and reporting data in Azure Sentinel

You can view this data by streaming it from the Azure Activity log into Azure Sentinel where you can then perform research and analytics on it.

1. Connect the [Azure Activity](connect-azure-activity.md) data source. After doing this, audit events are streamed into a new table in the **Logs** screen called AzureActivity.
2. Then, query the data using KQL, like you would any other table.
