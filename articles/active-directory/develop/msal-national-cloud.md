# <a name="use-msal-in-a-national-cloud-environment"></a>Use MSAL in a national cloud environment

[National clouds](authentication-national-cloud.md), also known as Sovereign clouds, are physically isolated instances of Azure. These regions of Azure help make sure that data residency, sovereignty, and compliance requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.

In addition to the Microsoft worldwide cloud, the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables application developers in national clouds to acquire tokens in order to authenticate and call secured web APIs. These web APIs can be Microsoft Graph or other Microsoft APIs.

Including the global cloud, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is deployed in the following national clouds:  

- Azure Government
- Azure 中国世纪互联
- Azure 德国

This guide demonstrates how to sign in to work and school accounts, get an access token, and call the Microsoft Graph API in the [Azure Government cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/) environment.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>必备组件

Before you start, make sure that you meet these prerequisites.

### <a name="choose-the-appropriate-identities"></a>Choose the appropriate identities

[Azure Government](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/) applications can use Azure AD Government identities and Azure AD Public identities to authenticate users. Because you can use any of these identities, you need to decide which authority endpoint you should choose for your scenario:

- Azure AD Public: Commonly used if your organization already has an Azure AD Public tenant to support Office 365 (Public or GCC) or another application.
- Azure AD Government: Commonly used if your organization already has an Azure AD Government tenant to support Office 365 (GCC High or DoD) or is creating a new tenant in Azure AD Government.

After you decide, a special consideration is where you perform your app registration. If you choose Azure AD Public identities for your Azure Government application, you must register the application in your Azure AD Public tenant.

### <a name="get-an-azure-government-subscription"></a>Get an Azure Government subscription

To get an Azure Government subscription, see [Managing and connecting to your subscription in Azure Government](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-manage-subscriptions).

If you don't have an Azure Government subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/) before you begin.

For details about using a national cloud with a particular programming language, choose the tab matching your language:

## <a name="nettabdonet"></a>[.NET](#tab/donet)

You can use MSAL.NET to sign in users, acquire tokens, and call the Microsoft Graph API in national clouds.

The following tutorials demonstrate how to build a .NET Core 2.2 MVC Web app. The app uses OpenID Connect to sign in users with a work and school account in an organization that belongs to a national cloud.

- To sign in users and acquire tokens, follow this tutorial: [Build an ASP.NET Core Web app signing-in users in sovereign clouds with the Microsoft identity platform](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-4-Sovereign#build-an-aspnet-core-web-app-signing-in-users-in-sovereign-clouds-with-the-microsoft-identity-platform).
- To call the Microsoft Graph API, follow this tutorial: [Using the Microsoft identity platform to call the Microsoft Graph API from an An ASP.NET Core 2.x Web App, on behalf of a user signing-in using their work and school account in Microsoft National Cloud](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/2-WebApp-graph-user/2-4-Sovereign-Call-MSGraph#using-the-microsoft-identity-platform-to-call-the-microsoft-graph-api-from-an-an-aspnet-core-2x-web-app-on-behalf-of-a-user-signing-in-using-their-work-and-school-account-in-microsoft-national-cloud).

## <a name="javascripttabjavascript"></a>[JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

To enable your MSAL.js application for sovereign clouds:

### <a name="step-1-register-your-application"></a>步骤 1：注册应用程序

1. 登录到 [Azure 门户](https://portal.azure.us/)。
    
   To find Azure portal endpoints for other national clouds, see [App registration endpoints](authentication-national-cloud.md#app-registration-endpoints).

1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the upper-right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
1. Go to the [App registrations](https://aka.ms/ra/ff) page on the Microsoft identity platform for developers.
1. “注册应用程序”页显示后，请输入应用程序的名称。
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory**.
1. In the **Redirect URI** section, select the **Web** platform and set the value to the application's URL based on your web server. See the next sections for instructions on how to set and obtain the redirect URL in Visual Studio and Node.
1. 选择“注册”。
1. 在应用的“概述”页上，记下“应用程序(客户端) ID”值。
1. This tutorial requires you to enable the [implicit grant flow](v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow.md). 在已注册的应用程序的左窗格中，选择“身份验证”。
1. 在“高级设置”部分的“隐式授权”下，选中“ID 令牌”和“访问令牌”复选框。 ID tokens and access tokens are required because this app needs to sign in users and call an API.
1. 选择“保存”。

### <a name="step-2--set-up-your-web-server-or-project"></a>Step 2:  Set up your web server or project

- [Download the project files](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/quickstart.zip) for a local web server, such as Node.

  或

- [Download the Visual Studio project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/archive/vsquickstart.zip).

Then skip to [Configure your JavaScript SPA](#step-4-configure-your-javascript-spa) to configure the code sample before running it.

### <a name="step-3-use-the-microsoft-authentication-library-to-sign-in-the-user"></a>Step 3: Use the Microsoft Authentication Library to sign in the user

Follow steps in the [JavaScript tutorial](tutorial-v2-javascript-spa.md#create-your-project) to create your project and integrate with MSAL to sign in the user.

### <a name="step-4-configure-your-javascript-spa"></a>Step 4: Configure your JavaScript SPA

在设置项目期间创建的 `index.html` 文件中，添加应用程序注册信息。 在 `index.html` 文件正文的 `<script></script>` 标记顶部添加以下代码：

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
    auth:{
        clientId: "Enter_the_Application_Id_here",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.us/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here",
        }
}

const graphConfig = {
        graphEndpoint: "https://graph.microsoft.us",
        graphScopes: ["user.read"],
}

// create UserAgentApplication instance
const myMSALObj = new UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);
```

In that code:

- `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` is the **Application (client) ID** value for the application that you registered.
- `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` is set to one of the following options:
    - If your application supports **Accounts in this organizational directory**, replace this value with the tenant ID or tenant name (for example, contoso.microsoft.com).
    - If your application supports **Accounts in any organizational directory**, replace this value with `organizations`.
    
    To find authentication endpoints for all the national clouds, see [Azure AD authentication endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Personal Microsoft accounts are not supported in national clouds.
  
- `graphEndpoint` is the Microsoft Graph endpoint for the Microsoft cloud for US government.

   To find Microsoft Graph endpoints for all the national clouds, see [Microsoft Graph endpoints in national clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints).

## <a name="pythontabpython"></a>[Python](#tab/python)

To enable your MSAL Python application for sovereign clouds:

- Register your application in a specific portal, depending on the cloud. For more information on how to choose the portal refer [App registration endpoints](authentication-national-cloud.md#app-registration-endpoints)
- Use any of the [samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/tree/dev/sample) from the repo with a few changes to the configuration, depending on the cloud, which is mentioned next.
- Use a specific authority, depending on the cloud you registered the application in. For more information on authorities for different clouds, refer [Azure AD Authentication endpoints](authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).

    Here's an example authority:

    ```json
    "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.us/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"
    ```
    
- To call Microsoft graph requires a specific Graph endpoint URL that depends on which cloud you are using. To find Microsoft Graph endpoints for all the national clouds, refer to [Microsoft Graph and Graph Explorer service root endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints).

    Here's an example of a graph endpoint, with scope:
    
    ```json
    "endpoint" : "https://graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/me"
    "scope": "User.Read"
    ```
    
## <a name="javatabjava"></a>[Java](#tab/java)

To enable your MSAL for Java application for sovereign clouds:

- Register your application in a specific portal, depending on the cloud. For more information on how to choose the portal refer [App registration endpoints](authentication-national-cloud.md#app-registration-endpoints)
- Use any of the [samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/tree/dev/src/samples) from the repo with a few changes to the configuration, depending on the cloud, which are mentioned next.
- Use a specific authority, depending on the cloud you registered the application in. For more information on authorities for different clouds, refer [Azure AD Authentication endpoints](authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).

Here's an example authority:

```json
"authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.us/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"
```

- To call Microsoft graph requires a specific Graph endpoint URL that depends on which cloud you are using. To find Microsoft Graph endpoints for all the national clouds, refer to [Microsoft Graph and Graph Explorer service root endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints).

Here's an example of a graph endpoint, with scope:

```json
"endpoint" : "https://graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/me"
"scope": "User.Read"
```

## <a name="objective-ctabobjc"></a>[Objective-C](#tab/objc)

MSAL for iOS and macOS can be used to acquire tokens in national clouds, but it requires additional configuration when creating `MSALPublicClientApplication`.

For instance, if you want your application to be a multi-tenant application in a national cloud (here US Government), you could write:

```objc
MSALAADAuthority *aadAuthority =
                [[MSALAADAuthority alloc] initWithCloudInstance:MSALAzureUsGovernmentCloudInstance
                                                   audienceType:MSALAzureADMultipleOrgsAudience
                                                      rawTenant:nil
                                                          error:nil];
                                                          
MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig *config =
                [[MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig alloc] initWithClientId:@"<your-client-id-here>"
                                                                redirectUri:@"<your-redirect-uri-here>"
                                                                  authority:aadAuthority];
                                                                  
NSError *applicationError = nil;
MSALPublicClientApplication *application =
                [[MSALPublicClientApplication alloc] initWithConfiguration:config error:&applicationError];
```

## <a name="swifttabswift"></a>[Swift](#tab/swift)

MSAL for iOS and macOS can be used to acquire tokens in national clouds, but it requires additional configuration when creating `MSALPublicClientApplication`.

For instance, if you want your application to be a multi-tenant application in a national cloud (here US Government), you could write:

```swift
let authority = try? MSALAADAuthority(cloudInstance: .usGovernmentCloudInstance, audienceType: .azureADMultipleOrgsAudience, rawTenant: nil)
        
let config = MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig(clientId: "<your-client-id-here>", redirectUri: "<your-redirect-uri-here>", authority: authority)
if let application = try? MSALPublicClientApplication(configuration: config) { /* Use application */}
```
