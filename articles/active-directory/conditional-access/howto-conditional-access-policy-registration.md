# <a name="conditional-access-require-trusted-location-for-mfa-registration"></a>Conditional Access: Require trusted location for MFA registration

Securing when and how users register for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and self-service password reset is now possible with user actions in Conditional Access policy. This preview feature is available to organizations who have enabled the [combined registration preview](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md). This functionality may be enabled in organizations where they want users to register for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and SSPR from a central location such as a trusted network location during HR onboarding. For more information about creating trusted locations in Conditional Access, see the article [What is the location condition in Azure Active Directory Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/location-condition.md#named-locations)
