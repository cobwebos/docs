For enterprises that use passwords today and have a shared PC environment, security keys provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Security keys provide improved productivity for workers, and have better security.

This document focuses on enabling security key based passwordless authentication. At the end of this article, you will be able to sign in to web-based applications with your Azure AD account using a FIDO2 security key.

1. 浏览到 [https://myprofile.microsoft.com](https://myprofile.microsoft.com)。
1. Sign in if not already.
1. Click **Security Info**.
   1. If the user already has at least one Azure Multi-Factor Authentication method registered, they can immediately register a FIDO2 security key.
   1. If they don’t have at least one Azure Multi-Factor Authentication method registered, they must add one.
1. Add a FIDO2 Security key by clicking **Add method** and choosing **Security key**.
1. Choose **USB device** or **NFC device**.
1. Have your key ready and choose **Next**.
1. A box will appear and ask the user to create/enter a PIN for your security key, then perform the required gesture for the key, either biometric or touch.
1. The user will be returned to the combined registration experience and asked to provide a meaningful name for the key so the user can identify which one if they have multiple. 单击“下一步”。
1. Click **Done** to complete the process.

Administrator provisioning and de-provisioning of security keys is not available in the public preview.

### <a name="upn-changes"></a>UPN changes

If a user’s UPN changes, you can no longer modify FIDO2 security keys to account for the change. The resolution is to reset the device and the user has to re-register their FIDO2 security keys.
