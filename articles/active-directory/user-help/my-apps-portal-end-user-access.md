Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension, if you're prompted. This extension helps you start any of your organization's cloud apps that require you to use a single sign-on process. If your organization has already set you up for single sign-on, the extension is installed automatically and you can skip this section.

This extension helps you:

- Sign in directly to apps from the sign-in page.

- Start any apps using the **Quick search** feature.

- See the last apps you used in the **Recently Used** section.

- Use internal company URLs while remote with [Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-application-proxy-get-started).
