# <a name="what-are-application-templates"></a>什么是应用程序模板？

Application templates in Azure IoT Central are a tool to help solution builders kickstart their IoT solution development. You can use app templates for everything from getting a feel for what is possible, to fully customizing and your application for resale to your customers.

Application templates consist of:

- 示例操作员仪表板
- Sample device templates
- Simulated devices producing real-time data
- 预配置的规则和作业
- Rich documentation including tutorials and how-tos

Your choice of application template determines whether your application uses IoT Central preview features such as Plug and Play for devices.

Currently, the application templates that use _generally available_ features are:

- Custom app > Custom application
- Custom app > Sample Contoso
- Custom app > Sample Devkits

Currently, the application templates that use _public preview_ features are:

- Custom app > Preview application
- Retail > Connected logistics
- Retail > Digital distribution center
