# <a name="tutorial-integrate-functions-with-an-azure-virtual-network"></a>Tutorial: integrate Functions with an Azure virtual network

This tutorial shows you how to use Azure Functions to connect to resources in an Azure virtual network. you'll create a function that has access to both the internet and to a VM running WordPress in virtual network.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a function app in the Premium plan
> * Deploy a WordPress site to VM in a virtual network
> * Connect the function app to the virtual network
> * Create a function proxy to access WordPress resources
> * Request a WordPress file from inside the virtual network

## <a name="topology"></a>拓扑

The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution that you create:

 ![UI for virtual network integration](./media/functions-create-vnet/topology.png)

Functions running in the Premium plan have the same hosting capabilities as web apps in Azure App Service, which includes the VNet Integration feature. To learn more about VNet Integration, including troubleshooting and advanced configuration, see [Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network](../app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md).

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>必备组件

For this tutorial, it's important that you understand IP addressing and subnetting. You can start with [this article that covers the basics of addressing and subnetting](https://support.microsoft.com/help/164015/understanding-tcp-ip-addressing-and-subnetting-basics). Many more articles and videos are available online.

如果还没有 Azure 订阅，可以在开始前创建一个[免费帐户](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)。

## <a name="create-a-function-app-in-a-premium-plan"></a>Create a function app in a Premium plan

First, you create a function app in the [Premium plan]. This plan provides serverless scale while supporting virtual network integration.

[!INCLUDE [functions-premium-create](../../includes/functions-premium-create.md)]  

You can pin the function app to the dashboard by selecting the pin icon in the upper right-hand corner. Pinning makes it easier to return to this function app after you create your VM.

## <a name="create-a-vm-inside-a-virtual-network"></a>Create a VM inside a virtual network

Next, create a preconfigured VM that runs WordPress inside a virtual network ([WordPress LEMP7 Max Performance](https://jetware.io/appliances/jetware/wordpress4_lemp7-170526/profile?us=azure) by Jetware). A WordPress VM is used because of its low cost and convenience. This same scenario works with any resource in a virtual network, such as REST APIs, App Service Environments, and other Azure services. 

1. In the portal, choose **+ Create a resource** on the left navigation pane, in the search field type `WordPress LEMP7 Max Performance`, and press Enter.

1. Choose **Wordpress LEMP Max Performance** in the search results. Select a software plan of **Wordpress LEMP Max Performance for CentOS** as the **Software Plan** and select **Create**.

1. In the **Basics** tab, use the VM settings as specified in the table below the image:

    ![Basics tab for creating a VM](./media/functions-create-vnet/create-vm-1.png)

    | 设置      | 建议的值  | 描述      |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | 订阅 | 你的订阅 | The subscription under which your resources are created. | 
    | **[Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md)**  | myResourceGroup | Choose `myResourceGroup`, or the resource group you created with your function app. Using the same resource group for the function app, WordPress VM, and hosting plan makes it easier to clean up resources when you are done with this tutorial. |
    | **虚拟机名称** | VNET-Wordpress | The VM name needs to be unique in the resource group |
    | **[Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)** | （欧洲）西欧 | Choose a region near you or near the functions that access the VM. |
    | **大小** | B1s | Choose **Change size** and then select the B1s standard image, which has 1 vCPU and 1 GB of memory. |
    | **身份验证类型** | 密码 | To use password authentication, you must also specify a **Username**, a secure **Password**, and then **Confirm password**. For this tutorial, you won't need to sign in to the VM unless you need to troubleshoot. |

1. Choose the **Networking** tab and under Configure virtual networks select **Create new**.

1. In **Create virtual network**, use the settings in the table below the image:

    ![Networking tab of create VM](./media/functions-create-vnet/create-vm-2.png)

    | 设置      | 建议的值  | 描述      |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | 名称 | myResourceGroup-vnet | You can use the default name generated for your virtual network. |
    | **地址范围** | 10.10.0.0/16 | Use a single address range for the virtual network. |
    | **子网名称** | Tutorial-Net | Name of the subnet. |
    | **Address range** (subnet) | 10.10.1.0/24   | The subnet size defines how many interfaces can be added to the subnet. This subnet is used by the WordPress site.  A `/24` subnet provides 254 host addresses. |

1. Select **OK** to create the virtual network.

1. Back in the **Networking** tab, choose **None** for **Public IP**.

1. Choose the **Management** tab, then in **Diagnostics storage account**, choose the Storage account you created with your function app.

1. 选择“查看 + 创建”。 After validation completes, select **Create**. The VM create process takes a few minutes. The created VM can only access the virtual network.

1. After the VM is created, choose **Go to resource** to view the page for your new VM, then choose **Networking** under **Settings**.

1. Verify that there's no **Public IP**. Make a note the **Private IP**, which you use to connect to the VM from your function app.

    ![Networking settings in the VM](./media/functions-create-vnet/vm-networking.png)

You now have a WordPress site deployed entirely within your virtual network. This site isn't accessible from the public internet.

## <a name="connect-your-function-app-to-the-virtual-network"></a>Connect your function app to the virtual network

With a WordPress site running in a VM in a virtual network, you can now connect your function app to that virtual network.

1. In your new function app, select **Platform features** > **Networking**.

    ![Choose networking in the function app](./media/functions-create-vnet/networking-0.png)

1. Under **VNet Integration**, select **Click here to configure**.

    ![Status for configuring a network feature](./media/functions-create-vnet/Networking-1.png)

1. On the virtual network integration page, select **Add VNet (preview)** .

    ![Add the VNet Integration preview](./media/functions-create-vnet/networking-2.png)

1. In **Network Feature Status**, use the settings in the table below the image:

    ![Define the function app virtual network](./media/functions-create-vnet/networking-3.png)

    | 设置      | 建议的值  | 描述      |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | **虚拟网络** | MyResourceGroup-vnet | This virtual network is the one you created earlier. |
    | 子网 | Create New Subnet | Create a subnet in the virtual network for your function app to use. VNet Integration must be configured to use an empty subnet. It doesn't matter that your functions use a different subnet than your VM. The virtual network automatically routes traffic between the two subnets. |
    | **子网名称** | Function-Net | 新子网的名称。 |
    | **Virtual network address block** | 10.10.0.0/16 | Choose the same address block used by the WordPress site. You should only have one address block defined. |
    | **地址范围** | 10.10.2.0/24   | The subnet size restricts the total number of instances that your Premium plan function app can scale out to. This example uses a `/24` subnet with 254 available host addresses. This subnet is over-provisioned, but easy to calculate. |

1. Select **OK** to add the subnet. Close the VNet Integration and Network Feature Status pages to return to your function app page.

The function app can now access the virtual network where the WordPress site is running. Next, you use [Azure Functions Proxies](functions-proxies.md) to return a file from the WordPress site.

## <a name="create-a-proxy-to-access-vm-resources"></a>Create a proxy to access VM resources

With VNet Integration enabled, you can create a proxy in your function app to forward requests to the VM running in the virtual network.

1. In your function app, select  **Proxies** >  **+** , then use the proxy settings in the table below the image:

    ![Define the proxy settings](./media/functions-create-vnet/create-proxy.png)

    | 设置  | 建议的值  | 描述      |
    | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | 名称 | Plant | The name can be any value. It's used to identify the proxy. |
    | **Route Template** | /plant | Route that maps to a VM resource. |
    | **Backend URL** | http://<YOUR_VM_IP>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/assets/images/header.jpg | Replace `<YOUR_VM_IP>` with the IP address of your WordPress VM that you created earlier. This mapping returns a single file from the site. |

1. Select **Create** to add the proxy to your function app.

## <a name="try-it-out"></a>试试看

1. In your browser, try to access the URL you used as the **Backend URL**. As expected, the request times out. A timeout occurs because your WordPress site is connected only to your virtual network and not the internet.

1. Copy the **Proxy URL** value from your new proxy and paste it into the address bar of your browser. The returned image is from the WordPress site running inside your virtual network.

    ![Plant image file returned from the WordPress site](./media/functions-create-vnet/plant.png)

Your function app is connected to both the internet and your virtual network. The proxy is receiving a request over the public internet, and then acting as a simple HTTP proxy to forward that request to the connected virtual network. The proxy then relays the response back to you publicly over the internet.

[!INCLUDE [clean-up-section-portal](../../includes/clean-up-section-portal.md)]

## <a name="next-steps"></a>后续步骤

In this tutorial, the WordPress site serves as an API that is called by using a proxy in the function app. This scenario makes a good tutorial because it's easy to set up and visualize. You could use any other API deployed within a virtual network. You could also have created a function with code that calls APIs deployed within the virtual network. A more realistic scenario is a function that uses data client APIs to call a SQL Server instance deployed in the virtual network.

Functions running in a Premium plan share the same underlying App Service infrastructure as web apps on PremiumV2 plans. All the documentation for [web apps in Azure App Service](../app-service/overview.md) applies to your Premium plan functions.
