# <a name="azure-functions-on-kubernetes-with-keda"></a>Azure Functions on Kubernetes with KEDA

The Azure Functions runtime provides flexibility in hosting where and how you want.  [KEDA](https://keda.sh) (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling) pairs seamlessly with the Azure Functions runtime and tooling to provide event driven scale in Kubernetes.

## <a name="how-kubernetes-based-functions-work"></a>How Kubernetes-based functions work

The Azure Functions service is made up of two key components: a runtime and a scale controller.  The Functions runtime runs and executes your code.  The runtime includes logic on how to trigger, log, and manage function executions.  The Azure Functions runtime can run *anywhere*.  The other component is a scale controller.  The scale controller monitors the rate of events that are targeting your function, and proactively scales the number of instances running your app.  若要了解更多信息，请参阅 [Azure Functions 的缩放和托管](functions-scale.md)。

Kubernetes-based Functions provides the Functions runtime in a [Docker container](functions-create-function-linux-custom-image.md) with event-driven scaling through KEDA.  KEDA can scale down to 0 instances (when no events are occurring) and up to *n* instances. It does this by exposing custom metrics for the Kubernetes autoscaler (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).  Using Functions containers with KEDA makes it possible to replicate serverless function capabilities in any Kubernetes cluster.  These functions can also be deployed using [Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) virtual nodes](../aks/virtual-nodes-cli.md) feature for serverless infrastructure.

## <a name="managing-keda-and-functions-in-kubernetes"></a>Managing KEDA and functions in Kubernetes

To run Functions on your Kubernetes cluster, you must install the KEDA component. You can install this component using [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md).

### <a name="installing-with-the-azure-functions-core-tools"></a>Installing with the Azure Functions Core Tools

By default, Core Tools installs both KEDA and Osiris components, which support event-driven and HTTP scaling, respectively.  The installation uses `kubectl` running in the current context.

Install KEDA in your cluster by running the following install command:

```cli
func kubernetes install --namespace keda
```

## <a name="deploying-a-function-app-to-kubernetes"></a>Deploying a function app to Kubernetes

You can deploy any function app to a Kubernetes cluster running KEDA.  Since your functions run in a Docker container, your project needs a `Dockerfile`.  If it doesn't already have one, you can add a Dockerfile by running the following command at the root of your Functions project:

```cli
func init --docker-only
```

To build an image and deploy your functions to Kubernetes, run the following command:

> [!NOTE]
> The core tools will leverage the docker CLI to build and publish the image. Be sure to have docker installed already and connected to your account with `docker login`.

```cli
func kubernetes deploy --name <name-of-function-deployment> --registry <container-registry-username>
```

> 将 `<name-of-function-deployment>` 替换为你的函数应用的名称。

This creates a Kubernetes `Deployment` resource, a `ScaledObject` resource, and `Secrets`, which includes environment variables imported from your `local.settings.json` file.

### <a name="deploying-a-function-app-from-a-private-registry"></a>Deploying a function app from a private registry

The above flow works for private registries as well.  If you are pulling your container image from a private registry, include the `--pull-secret` flag that references the Kubernetes secret holding the private registry credentials when running `func kubernetes deploy`.

## <a name="removing-a-function-app-from-kubernetes"></a>Removing a function app from Kubernetes

After deploying you can remove a function by removing the associated `Deployment`, `ScaledObject`, an `Secrets` created.

```cli
kubectl delete deploy <name-of-function-deployment>
kubectl delete ScaledObject <name-of-function-deployment>
kubectl delete secret <name-of-function-deployment>
```

## <a name="uninstalling-keda-from-kubernetes"></a>Uninstalling KEDA from Kubernetes

You can run the following core tools command to remove KEDA from a Kubernetes cluster:

```cli
func kubernetes remove --namespace keda
```

## <a name="supported-triggers-in-keda"></a>Supported triggers in KEDA

KEDA has support for the following Azure Function triggers:

* [Azure Storage Queues](functions-bindings-storage-queue.md)
* [Azure Service Bus Queues](functions-bindings-service-bus.md)
* [Azure Event / IoT Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs.md)
* [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-kafka-extension)
* [RabbitMQ Queue](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension)

### <a name="http-trigger-support"></a>HTTP Trigger support

You can use Azure Functions that expose HTTP triggers, but KEDA doesn't directly manage them.  The Azure Functions Core Tools will install a related project, Osiris, that enables scaling HTTP endpoints from 0 to 1.  Scaling from 1 to *n* would rely on the traditional Kubernetes scaling policies.
