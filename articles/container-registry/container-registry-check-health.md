# <a name="check-the-health-of-an-azure-container-registry"></a>Check the health of an Azure container registry

When using an Azure container registry, you might occasionally encounter problems. For example, you might not be able to pull a container image because of an issue with Docker in your local environment. Or, a network issue might prevent you from connecting to the registry. 

As a first diagnostic step, run the [az acr check-health][az-acr-check-health] command to get information about the health of the environment and optionally access to a target registry. This command is available in Azure CLI version 2.0.67 or later. 如果需要进行安装或升级，请参阅[安装 Azure CLI][azure-cli]。

## <a name="run-az-acr-check-health"></a>Run az acr check-health

The follow examples show different ways to run the `az acr check-health` command.

> [!NOTE]
> If you run the command in Azure Cloud Shell, the local environment is not checked. However, you can check the access to a target registry.

### <a name="check-the-environment-only"></a>Check the environment only

To check the local Docker daemon, CLI version, and Helm client configuration, run the command without additional parameters:

```azurecli
az acr check-health
```

### <a name="check-the-environment-and-a-target-registry"></a>Check the environment and a target registry

To check access to a registry as well as perform local environment checks, pass the name of a target registry. 例如：

```azurecli
az acr check-health --name myregistry
```

## <a name="error-reporting"></a>错误报告

The command logs information to the standard output. If a problem is detected, it provides an error code and description. For more information about the codes and possible solutions, see the [error reference](container-registry-health-error-reference.md).

By default, the command stops whenever it finds an error. You can also run the command so that it provides output for all health checks, even if errors are found. Add the `--ignore-errors` parameter, as shown in the following examples:

```azurecli
# Check environment only
az acr check-health --ignore-errors

# Check environment and target registry
az acr check-health --name myregistry --ignore-errors
```      

示例输出：

```console
$ az acr check-health --name myregistry --ignore-errors --yes
